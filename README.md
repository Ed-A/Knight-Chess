# Knight Chess

This is a simplified chess game featuring a single knight on a 5x5 board. The player can move the knight, and the board will highlight all possible moves based on the knight's movement rules in chess.

## Features
- A 5x5 chessboard with a single knight piece.
- Highlights all valid knight moves from the current position.
- Click-based movement: Click on the knight to display possible moves, then click on a highlighted square to move the knight.
- Automatically updates the board and resets available moves after each move.

## How to Play
1. Open the webpage and you will see a 5x5 board with a knight placed on it.
2. Click on the knight to display its valid moves.
3. The valid moves will be highlighted in orange.
4. Click on a highlighted square to move the knight to that position.
5. The process can be repeated for any new knight position.

## Files
- `index.html`: The main HTML structure for the chessboard.
- `style.css`: Contains the styling for the chessboard and the knight.
- `script.js`: Handles the knight's movement logic and user interactions.

## How it Works
- When the knight is clicked, the board highlights all possible knight moves (L-shaped moves typical in chess).
- Clicking on a valid square moves the knight and resets the board.
